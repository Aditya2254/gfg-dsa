// arrays																|												linked list
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 1. arrays is a sequential data structure, it has to store data in conuiguous locations but linked list doesn't has to store at contiguous locations.
// 2. In arrays, Either size is fixed and pre-allocated(in both fixed and variable sized arrays), OR the worst case insertion at the end is theta(n).
// 3. In arrays, insertion at the middle(or beginning) is costly.
// 4. In arrays, deletion at the middle(or beginning) is costly.
// 5. Implementation of data structures like queue and dequeue is complex with arrays.
// 6. In case of Merge sort, we can implement it using linked list without using any extra space.
// 7. Arrays have less memory requirement and linked list has better memory utilization.
